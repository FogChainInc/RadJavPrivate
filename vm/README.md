# What is RadJavVM?
The installable virtual machine for the end-user on desktop and mobile. It builds and embeds libRadJav, then calls libRadJav when its time for RadJav apps to run.

# How to build
We use CMake to generate the project files for each OS.

Since there's so much information about how to build on each different OS, please visit our wiki page on [Building RadJavVM from source](https://github.com/FogChainInc/RadJav/wiki#building-radjav-vm-from-source)
