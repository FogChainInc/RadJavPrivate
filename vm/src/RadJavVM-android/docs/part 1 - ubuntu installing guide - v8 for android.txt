V8 for android builds only on unix-like systems, this guide will cover ubuntu 18.04 steps,
build steps should be pretty much the same for Mac, but some details may differ.
Some steps are optional, so it will be good to read all steps before starting the setup.
Cross-compiling could be time-consuming

1) installing cmake (minimum required version is 3.11 for boost 1_67)
>>> home/$

sudo apt remove cmake
sudo wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.12/cmake-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
sudo chmod +x cmake-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

sudo mkdir /opt/cmake
sudo cp cmake-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh /opt/cmake/
cd /opt/cmake/
sudo ./cmake-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
sudo ln -s /opt/cmake/cmake-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64/bin/cmake /usr/local/bin/cmake
cmake --version

now cmake should point to the 3.12.0 version
remove install script:

cd /home/
rm cmake-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

1a) good thing is to install ccmake if linux build system is console-only
sudo apt install ccmake-curses-gui

note that cmake version from ccmake installation could be lower than required for building radjav library,
so probably it is better to start with ccmake and then go to updating cmake and its symlinks

2) Building V8:
First, make sure you can [build with GN](Building with GN).
next steps are taken from https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Building-with-GN

setting depot tools:
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
nano ~/.bashrc

add at the end of file:
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/depot_tools

and if you don't like editing gn file with vi, also set default editor to nano:
export EDITOR='nano'

close the file, then type this: 
exec bash

 - this is to restart bash session and apply exports from bashrc file
 
after that you can go for v8 build by executing the following in your terminal/shell:

fetch v8
cd v8
gclient sync
./build/install-build-deps.sh

Generate the necessary build files by executing the following in your terminal/shell:

tools/dev/v8gen.py x64.release

Compile the source by executing the following in your terminal/shell:

ninja -C out.gn/x64.release

Run the tests by executing the following in your terminal/shell:

tools/run-tests.py --gn

3) Now prepare the cross-compilation tools:
(taken from https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Cross-compiling-for-ARM )

/home/radjav/v8$ nano ../.gclient
add this in the end of file:
target_os = ['android', 'unix']  # multiple target oses

run gclient sync
>> this will download a lot of third_party/android_tools dependencies

Use v8gen.py to generate an arm release or debug build:

tools/dev/v8gen.py arm.release

Then run `gn args out.gn/arm.release' and make sure you have the following keys:
(note that we build here library as small components, so is_component_build must be set to true)
target_os = "android"      # These lines need to be changed manually
target_cpu = "arm"         # as v8gen.py assumes a simulator build.
v8_target_cpu = "arm"
is_component_build = true

Now build:

ninja -C out.gn/arm.release

Check that v8, v8 platform and natives blobs binaries present in output directory

4) NOTE that arm.release will contain only one build configuration binaries - armeabi-v7a for arm.release flag,
arm64-v8a for arm64.release etc. for 64-bit build you should do

tools/dev/v8gen.py arm64.release

Then run `gn args out.gn/arm64.release' and make sure you have the following keys:
(note that we build here library as small components, so is_component_build must be set to true)
target_os = "android"
target_cpu = "arm64"
v8_target_cpu = "arm64"
is_component_build = true

Next steps of this guide will use arm64.release configuration of v8, so you should consider building at least arm64.release at this point
