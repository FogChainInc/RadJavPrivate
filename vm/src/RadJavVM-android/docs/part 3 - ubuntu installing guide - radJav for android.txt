When parts 1 and 2 complete we'll have minimal dependencies to make android version of libRadJav (without wxwidgets, DBs, etc.)
Only the 'library' part of our cmake files required, logic from 'vm' part goes to native android and/or java code.

6) generate a standalone toolchain for desired build configuration (see https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/standalone_toolchain for additional info). This can be done by built-in python script from NDK located in v8 third_party dir:
 
 cd <your path>/v8/third_party/android_ndk/
 
 run in console
 
 build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --arch arm64 --api 21 --stl=libc++ --install-dir /tmp/arm64-21stllib-android-toolchain
 
 <here I'm not sure if this step is required, I'll check it later. Try without it as we provide path to ndk later
   export PATH=$PATH:'pwd'/arm64-21stllib-android-toolchain/bin
 >

7) go to the /library/CMake/toolchain and edit android.cmake file

set (CMAKE_SYSROOT "/tmp/arm64-21stllib-android-toolchain/sysroot") line should point to generated standalone toolchain
CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK should point to your v8/third_party/android_ndk directory

8) go to the /RadJavPrivate/library

 mkdir build-arm64-v8a
 cd build-arm64-v8a/
 
 run in console
 ccmake ../ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../CMake/toolchain/android.cmake
 
 (if you've installed only cmake 3.12 without updating ccmake in the system, it will probably use older version of cmake. In this case you can run ccmake directly from your cmake installation location, for example
 /opt/cmake/cmake-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64/bin/ccmake ../ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../CMake/toolchain/android.cmake

 it will show you the empty cache prompt, wait a little bit and press [c] to configure

 set BOOST_ROOT path to /home/radjav/Boost-for-Android/build/out/arm64-v8a
 Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to ON
 CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE should be taken from the android.cmake file,
 FIND_MEMORY_LEAKS OFF
 INCLUDE_CRYPTOGRAPHY OFF
 INCLUDE_DATABASES OFF
 USE_ARCH arm64-v8a
 V8_SOURCE /home/radjav/v8/
 XML_SUPPORT OFF
 libRadJav_ALLOW_NETWORKING OFF
 libRadJav_DEBUG_INSPECTOR OFF
 libRadJav_EMBEDFILE ON
 libRadJav_EMBEDFILE_CMAKE ON
 libRadJav_GUI_LIBRARY <clear that field>
 libRadJav_INCLUDE_BLOCKCHAIN OFF
 libRadJav_INCLUDE_C3D_API OFF
 libRadJav_STATIC ON
 
 press [c] to configure
 
 press [t] to toggle to advanced mode
 
 USE_SNAPPY OFF
 
 press [c] to configure
 press [g] to generate and exit
 
 run make
 
 check binary build:
  readelf -h liblibRadJav_d.a
 
 it should give you 'Machine:  AArch64' from one of the ELF headers
